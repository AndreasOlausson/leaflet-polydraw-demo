# Leaflet Polydraw

_A modern Leaflet plugin for intuitive freehand polygon drawing and advanced spatial editing — fully compatible with Leaflet 1.x and 2.x._

**Live Demo**: [https://polydraw.ao-tech.se](https://polydraw.ao-tech.se)

> **Advanced Leaflet plugin for freehand polygon drawing, with smart merging and powerful editing tools**

**Leaflet.Polydraw** lets you draw polygons directly on Leaflet maps in a natural freehand way — click and drag to sketch shapes.  
It also supports point-to-point precision drawing, intelligent polygon merging, drag-and-drop repositioning, and a rich set of editing tools.  
This makes it ideal for GIS platforms, mapping applications, and spatial data workflows.

- **Freehand Drawing**: Draw polygons naturally by sketching directly on the map — click and drag to create shapes in real time.
- **Smart Polygon Merging**: Automatically detects and merges overlapping polygons (including smooth C-to-O shape completion).
- **Drag & Drop Editing**: Intuitive polygon repositioning with intelligent spatial interactions.
- **Advanced Vertex Editing**: Drag vertices, add or remove points, and reshape polygons seamlessly.
- **Point-to-Point Mode**: Optional precise vertex-by-vertex drawing for detailed or structured geometry.
- **Hole Support**: Create complex polygons with holes and nested structures effortlessly.
- **Smart Markers**: Adaptive marker placement prevents overlaps and maintains visual clarity.
- **Modifier Shortcuts**: Hold Ctrl or Cmd to toggle erase, subtract, or advanced edit modes for a smooth workflow.
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering and event handling even for large datasets.
- **Coordinate Auto-Detection**: Accepts multiple coordinate formats automatically (lat/lng, DMS, DDM, N/E, etc.).
- **Leaflet 1.x & 2.x Compatible**: Fully compatible with both generations of the Leaflet API.
- **TypeScript Ready**: Includes complete type definitions for modern development workflows.
